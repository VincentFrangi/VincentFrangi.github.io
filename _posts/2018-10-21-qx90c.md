Recently, I bought an incredible mini quadrocopter the **Eachine QX90C** on [bangood](https://www.banggood.com/fr/Eachine-Tiny-QX90C-90mm-Micro-FPV-Racing-Quadcopter-Based-On-F3-EVO-Brushed-Flight-Controller-p-1093924.html?ID=517238522807&cur_warehouse=CN).

The Eachine QX70, QX90, QX95 serie are the perfect choice for beginner and people who want to flight inside their home during the winter with a price of 50 bucks.

Despite his ridiculous size, they have a real flight controller and the BNF (Bind and fly)come with integrated FrSky or DSM2/DSMX or Flysky receiver.

So you can use the material that you are used to:

* Remote controller
* FPV googles
* Flight controller configuration software

**QX90C Specs**

* Brushed motors
* Flight controller SP RACING F3_EVO
* Cleanfligth 1.13.0
* Size 55mm
* Battery 1s Lipo

# Betaflight

The QX90C come with preinstalled [Cleanflig](http://cleanflight.com/)
which is very nice but I am used to betaflight.

* Board **F3_EVO_BRUSHED**

## Flash the firmware on linux

Here are the instruction to flash Betaflight on your board.
[Betafligth wiki - Installing Betaflight](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/Installing-Betaflight)

> **Note**: It didn't work for my on Archlinux, I flashed it with Windows

### Instructions

Create udev specific rules
```bash
(echo '# DFU (Internal bootloader for STM32 MCUs)'
 echo 'ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="df11", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"') | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/45-stdfu-permissions.rules > /dev/null
 ```
You have to add yourself to the **plugdev** group
 ```
 sudo usermod -a -G plugdev <username>
 ```

1. Unplug battery and USB
2. Acces to the **boot** pins on the board
3. Jump the pin with a screw driver
4. Plug the USB cable
   * The blue LED **should not** flash
5. Open betaflight configurator
   * you should see the device as *dfu* (Device Firmware Update)
6. Go to **Firmare Flasher**
7. Selectec the board : **SPRACINGF3EVO**
