# Mushroom Collecting

Bored of programming, eyes tired of screens, you just burn your dev board ? Go and play the IRL Pokemon, not Pokekemon Go, but go in the forest to collect mushroom !

This is one of my favorite hobby, because you get free food and it feel like easter eggs searching!

## Tutorial

1. Learn about mushrooms
2. Collect them
3. Be sure you won't die
4. Eat
5. Return to 2.

or

```bash
sudo apt-get mushrooms
```

## My personal favorite
